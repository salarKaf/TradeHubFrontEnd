figma has a bug with MVAR(Metrics Variation Table) cause variable fonts has a hug line height,
figma Versions has no MVAR table(all other things are the same)

these versions during the install will replace with the main versions, if your OS asks you to
replace the fonts, press no and manually delet the main versions, then install the figma versions.
if you pressed yes, delete all fonts from your system, restart your OS, check if any font with this
typeface exist and delet them again, and finally reinstall the fonts. a restart maybe required
to prevent font cash problems.
